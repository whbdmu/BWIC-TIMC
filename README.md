## Introduction
In this paper, a novel Between/Within View Information Completing for Tensorial Incomplete Multi-view Clustering (BWIC-TIMC) has been proposed, in which between/within view information is jointly exploited for effectively completing the missing views. Specifically, the proposed method designs a dual tensor constraint module, which focuses on simultaneously exploring the view-specific correlations of incomplete views and enforcing the between view consistency across different views. With the dual tensor constraint, between/within view information can be effectively integrated for completing missing views for IMvC task. Furthermore, in order to balance different contributions of multiple views and alleviate the problem of feature degeneration, BWIC-TIMC implements an adaptive fusion graph learning strategy for consensus representation learning.
